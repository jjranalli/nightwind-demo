            <p>As an experienced consultant we have perfected a lean and agile approach to make sure that each client project gets exactly what it needs in order to be a long-term success. The projects we work on cooperatively with our clients' internal developers are based on a strong project management team that also takes the position of mentor and trainer when needed.</p>
            <p>What we've learned from our experience with other technologies is the importance of a strong network. Thus we began hosting regular local Laravel events for developers in the economically strong Rhein-Main region in 2016.</p>
